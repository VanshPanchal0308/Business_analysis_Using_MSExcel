# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project

## **Aim Of The Project :** 
This project focuses on analyzing a sales dataset from a coffee shop, containing detailed information such as transaction ID, transaction date, transaction time, quantity ordered, store number, product type, price, and cup size using MSExcel.

## **About Project:**
I utilized Microsoft Excel to clean and process the data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Following the data preparation, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides meaningful insights into the business's performance. This dashboard allows for the easy visualization of key metrics, helping to identify trends, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making.

This project is an excellent example of how data can be transformed into actionable insights, and it serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis and visualization skills using MS Excel.
